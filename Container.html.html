            <p>Reading books has been a timeless source of entertainment and education. Books have the magical ability to teleport you across timezones and eras. They are the fool-proof way of acquiring a flair understanding of any language, from vocabulary to colloquial expressions.
        
                So, if you are a novice reader and want to upscale your reading skills, we recommend you read these ten best novels for beginners that are absolutely timeless classics yet easy to read and understand.</p>
                <p>Transition language, transition words or transition phrases are used to link other words, phrases and sentences.
                   They do so in a way that makes the sentence sound human, natural and in flow. Transition language works particularly well in written articles, books and blogs,
                    which would otherwise sound rather robotic.
                     So they’re a powerful addition to your marketing content, which needs to persuade, entertain, engage and inform all at the same time.

                  I’m sure you’ve read something that simply reported facts,
                   moving abruptly robotically from one sentence to the next. It may have sounded almost Siri-like. As if the sentences were on a supermarket conveyor belt,
                    being checked out one by one.
                  
                  A great piece of writing, whether you’re writing a book or a blog,
                   needs softening and smoothening out so that your reader can engage more empathetically with the information and keep their focus naturally.
                    As a writer, your job is take your reader’s hand and guide them through the text.
